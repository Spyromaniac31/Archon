# Archon
Archon is a modern Windows app built from the ground up designed for remotely managing a Linux dedicated ARK server.

## What can Archon do?
Archon can:
* Start and stop the ARK server
* Save the game while it is running
* Update the ARK installation
* Generate configuration files (Game.ini, GameUserSettings.ini) and the server start script using a user-friendly GUI

## Prerequisites
* Your server must support SSH for Archon to function
* If your server is not on the same network as Archon, port forwarding must be set up as needed
