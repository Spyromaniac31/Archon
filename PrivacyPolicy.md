## User information

To function, Archon requires user credentials to access the computer on which the ARK server is installed. The developer does not collect this data in any way and cannot access the information you submit. 
All user information is stored either locally in the app's data, or, in the case of server credentials, stored in the password vault associated with your Microsoft account.
